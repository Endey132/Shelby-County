----- Mineral Processing -----

Ore node is mined for mineral item, mineral item is processed in mineral concentration factory for mineral concentrate, mineral concentrate is put into mineral electrolysis chamber to give raw metal(s), raw metals are refined in a blast furnace to give refined metals, refined metals are put in lathes to produce parts (Or could make them with hand tools at reduced efficiency,) parts are used to make items.
