--- Crafting Recipe Legend ---

Everything before ">" is an input item; everything afterwards is the output.
Input items in [] brackets are not consumed during crafting.
Input items in {} brackets are crafting stations required to craft a certain item.
Numbers before item names represent the quantity of items required for a recipe.
Items in "" Quotations represent spawn tables and will give items according to the table's odds (Not applicable to crafting recipes.)

If a line starts with "!", it represents a processing chain, not a crafting recipe, and is only there for documentation purposes. All lines below refer to processing chains, and do not apply to crafting recipes.
Processing chain items that are in {} brackets represent the tools or crafting stations needed for the listed output
() brackets represent notes in processing chains
[] brackets represent secondary outputs in processing chains, which are not required for the following step.
Items between @@ symbols are external to the processing chain, but are required for the next step
