-Smooth terrain around river

-Detail map; firehydrants on sidewalks, power lines, mailboxes & dumpsters infront of houses, appropriate traffic signs in rural intersections, traffic lights

-Add more minerals

-Spawns for rocks on river

-Bush foraging for string fiber, and berries

-Models for raw minerals, mineral concentrate, raw metal (Vanilla scrap), refined metal

-Add mineral deposits to quarries

-Find way to prevent player names from showing on death screen, while looking at a player, and prevent voice icons from showing in player list





----- Mineral Processing -----

Ore node is mined for mineral item, mineral item is processed in mineral concentration factory for mineral concentrate, mineral concentrate is put into mineral electrolysis chamber to give raw metal(s), raw metals are refined in a blast furnace to give refined metals, refined metals are put in lathes to produce parts (Or could make them with hand tools at reduced efficiency,) parts are used to make items.
