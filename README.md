----- TODO -----

-Detail map; firehydrants on sidewalks, power lines, mailboxes & dumpsters infront of houses, appropriate traffic signs in rural intersections, traffic lights

-Bush foraging for berries

-Add input items used in manufacturing

-Add mineral deposits to quarries

-Finish Die Casting Machine texture

-Find way to prevent player names from showing on death screen, while looking at a player, and prevent voice icons from showing in player list

-"Vehicle Deployment Kit" backpack, is the only way to have vehicle assemblies in your inventory for deployment (Assemblies would need a big, flat terrain in order to be deployed, and would have a 30-45 second deployment period)

-Add opium processing

-Crafting progress UIs

-Custom smoke grenades


----- Mineral Processing -----

Ore node is mined for mineral item, mineral item is processed in mineral concentration factory for mineral concentrate, mineral concentrate is put into mineral electrolysis chamber to give raw metal(s), raw metals are refined in a blast furnace to give refined metals, refined metals are put in lathes to produce parts (Or could make them with hand tools at reduced efficiency,) parts are used to make items.
