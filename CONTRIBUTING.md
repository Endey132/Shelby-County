- Issue Guidelines

1. If you find an exploit that has the potential to do a lot of bad to the server, do not open an issue, but PM me (Endey#9550) on discord instead.

2. Tag your issues appropriately (if you are suggesting a new feature, tag it with as an enhancement, if you are reporting a bug, tag it as a bug, etc)





- Contributing General Guidelines

1. Label your commits in present tense, briefly describing changes that have been made in your commit.

2. Test your commits and make sure they're working before submiting a pull request.





- Map Guidelines

1. Keep in mind that map edits generally can not merge with eachother. This means that if multiple people are working on edits simultaniously, repository maintainers will be unable to keep the changes of both contributors, and will pick whichever commit they deem more important. This means that you should not make any edits to the map if you see that there is an open pull request involving edits to any of the following files/folders: Editor, Environment (with the exception of Ambience.unity3d and Roads.unity3d,) Landscape, Level, Spawns, Terrain (Excluding Details.unity3d & Materials.unity3d,) Foliage.blob, Level.dat, or Level.heirarchy.

2. Avoid making changes to the map that would change the balance of the server without a maintainer's approval (changing the amount of ore nodes in the mines, messing with important spawn tables, etc)





- Crafting Recipe Guidelines

1. If you ever make a change to any crafting recipe or implement a new crafting recipe, update the readme.md crafting documentation section as well.





- Unity/Modeling Guidelines

1. If you intend on working on the unity project, first create a new project named "PECO-Unity" inside of the directory you're going to clone the repository to, using Unity version 2019.4.25f1 (Will update stated version whenever the repository's version is changed.)

2. Try to categorize new assets in the same was as existing assets.

3. When making new assets, save them as a .blend file rather than exporting as .fbx or .obj.
