- Issue Guidelines

1. If you find an exploit that has the potential to do a lot of bad to the server, do not open an issue, but PM me (Endey#9550) on discord instead.

2. Tag your issues appropriately (if you are suggesting a new feature, tag it as an enhancement, if you are reporting a bug, tag it as a bug, etc)





- Map Guidelines

1. Keep in mind that map edits generally can not merge with eachother. This means that if multiple people are working on edits simultaniously, repository maintainers will be unable to keep the changes of both contributors, and will pick whichever commit they deem more important. This means that you should not make any edits to the map if you see that there is an open pull request involving edits to any of the following files/folders: Editor, Environment (with the exception of Ambience.unity3d and Roads.unity3d,) Landscape, Level, Spawns, Terrain (Excluding Details.unity3d & Materials.unity3d,) Foliage.blob, Level.dat, or Level.heirarchy.

2. Avoid making changes to the map that would change the balance of the server without a maintainer's approval (changing the amount of ore nodes in the mines, messing with important spawn tables, etc)

3. Make sure you've subscribed to all of the server's workshop mods before editing the map (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2328257711)
